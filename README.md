# Sprint 4, Build an Phone Book

Today's assignment is to build an smaller API â€“ the server side of a phone book. The API can later be used to build webpages like Eniro or Hitta.se. You're API should return name, phone number and email address from a given blob of json. 

@Damien, add something about postman here! 

Your API should have two end-points: 
1. One that returns everything that is in the phone book. 
1. One that returns all info for a specific person. 

If the person you are searching for does not exist you should return a `404 message`. 

:rotating_light: The assignment is only to buld the server side, so let's save the frontend for stretch goals. :rotating_light:

### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. So whenever you get stuck start with step 1 and continue until problem solved.

1. Google! In English, type in the error message if there is one, search within the language you're using (ie CSS, JavaScript etc).
2. Ask your code buddies in your Company.
3. Ask your fellow students in Slack.
4. Ask Damien. Please note: we are part of a sharing community - share the answer with your fellows.

### :boom: Success!

After completing this assignment you should be comfortable with how to find and use external React libraries you find online. You should also get a little practice using array functions to select and clean data. Hopefully you'll have a little insight into what WebSockets can do, too!

### :runner: Stretch Goals

Stretch goals for this project are entirely up to you, and depend very much on what library you chose. Try to find something challenging to implement using the library, or find a new library to set up!

Also, a great stretch goal would be to read up on WebSockets and to try to understand the code in code/src/gdax-websocket.js.
